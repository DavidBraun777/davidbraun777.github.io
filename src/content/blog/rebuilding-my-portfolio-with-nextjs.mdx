After years of using a traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript portfolio, I decided it was time for a complete rebuild. Here's why I chose Next.js and what I learned along the way.

## Why Rebuild?

My previous portfolio was built with Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript. While it served me well, it had several limitations:

- **Performance**: Multiple third-party libraries (AOS, Isotope, Typed.js) added unnecessary weight
- **Maintainability**: HTML files became difficult to update as content grew
- **Modern Stack**: I wanted to showcase my React and TypeScript skills
- **Dark Mode**: Adding dark mode to the old site would have been a nightmare

## Tech Stack Choices

### Next.js 14 with App Router

Next.js was an obvious choice for several reasons:

- **React Server Components** for optimal performance
- **Built-in API routes** for the contact form
- **Image optimization** out of the box
- **Static generation** for fast page loads

### TypeScript

Type safety isn't just about catching bugs—it's about documentation. When I look at my code months later, TypeScript tells me exactly what each function expects and returns.

### Tailwind CSS

I was initially skeptical of utility-first CSS, but Tailwind has won me over:

```css
/* Before: Multiple CSS files */
.button-primary {
  background-color: #3b82f6;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.75rem 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}

/* After: Inline with Tailwind */
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-6 py-3 rounded-lg">
```

The dark mode support is fantastic—just prefix classes with `dark:` and you're done.

### Framer Motion

Animations can make or break a portfolio. Framer Motion provides:

- Declarative animations that are easy to understand
- Scroll-triggered animations with `whileInView`
- Exit animations for page transitions
- Physics-based springs for natural movement

## Key Features

### Dynamic Dark Mode

Using `next-themes`, implementing dark mode was straightforward:

```typescript
const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
```

The theme persists across sessions and respects system preferences.

### MDX Blog

I wanted a blog without the overhead of a CMS. MDX lets me write posts in Markdown while embedding React components when needed.

### API-Powered Contact Form

The contact form uses Next.js API routes with Resend for email delivery—no external form services needed.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with the data**: Defining TypeScript interfaces for experiences, projects, and skills before building components saved time
2. **Component composition**: Breaking the site into small, reusable pieces made styling consistent
3. **Animation restraint**: It's tempting to animate everything, but subtle animations are more professional

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:

- More blog posts on cybersecurity and AI
- Interactive project demos
- A dark mode toggle with system preference detection
